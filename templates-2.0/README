# SNID templates-2.0

######################
# GENERAL INFORMATION
######################

This new set of SNID templates includes the original template set
(corrected for minor bugs!) distributed with snid-5.0, augmented with
(most) SN Ia spectra with phase information from the CfA SN Program
published by Blondin et al. (2012), and including literature data when
publicly available. 

Note that the new templates are named snYYYYxx.lnw and lbvYYYYxx.lnw
for SN and LBV(-like) objects (as opposed to snYYxx.lnw and
lbvYYxx.lnw in the original template set). The template for the
peculiar SN Ia SNLS-03D3bb (Howell et al. 2006; IAU name SN 2003fg)
has been renamed from sn03fg.lnw to snls03D3bb.lnw.

The templates-2.0 set also includes the following new templates:

#name		subtype		Ref.
sn1984A 	Ia-norm		Wegner87,Barbon89
sn2003bg 	IIb		Hamuy09
sn2003hv 	Ia-norm		Leloudas10
sn2005cg 	Ia-norm		Quimby06
sn2007Y 	Ib-norm		Stritzinger09
sn2008D 	Ib-pec		Modjaz08

This new set consists of 3754 spectra of 349 templates (compared to
1515 spectra of 111 templates for the original set).

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
############################

To use this new template set with snid-5.0, follow these steps:

1. unpack the templates-2.0.tgz tarball in your snid-5.0 installation
directory. This will create directory named templates-2.0/ . You can
then safely remove the .tgz file.

2. edit line 52 of the snidmore.f file in the source/ directory to
point to this new template directory:

      tempdir='INSTALL_DIR/snid-5.0/templates-2.0/'

(alternatively you can use the tempdir= option when running SNID)

3. edit lines 47 and 52 of the snid.inc file in the source/ directory
to allow for more template files:

      parameter (MAXPPT = 50000)
      parameter (MAXTEMP = 10000)

4. recompile SNID. Execute the following commands in your snid-5.0
installation directory:

	make realclean
	make
	make install

That's it!
